Designing the Enclosure:

- Go to https://en.makercase.com/ 
- Decide which box design 
    - List benefits to the different types of designs
- Input measurements for the box
- Check the visualization and Save 


1. Figure what kind of enclosure you want. Enclosures can be made out of many different materials depending on the purpose and usage of the project. However, for this section we will focus on acrylic for the enclosure. 
Benefits for acrylic:
Excellent optical clarity & transparency
Highly resistant to variations in temperature
Up to 17 times the impact resistance of ordinary glass
Half the weight of glass and idea for precision machining
Highly resistant to different chemicals
Disadvantages for acrylic:
Acrylic is touch and durable, but can also be easily scratched
Choose an enclosure design. Using a design platform like, https://en.makercase.com/, you can choose from 3 different enclosure designs: Basic box, polygon box, kerf bent box. 
Modify enclosure design. Using the same platform you can now modify the box your creating. 
Modifications include width, height, and depth of the box. Using the prior measurements you took input the amounts to see a virtual display of your enclosure. You can also indicate whether the measurements are for the inner or outer dimensions.
The thickness of your box should correspond to the acrylic piece you will be using.
You can also decide whether you’d like the box to be open or closed
Finally, choose the type of edge you’d like for the box. Using a flat or finger edge will require the use of acrylic glue to stablize the enclosure. Note: if you need to access the inside of the box, this would be made difficult with these choices. Alternatively, t-slot edges are held with bolts. You can decide the type of bolt diameter and length depending on what you have available. This allows you to access the inside of the box if any debugging or adjustments are necessary while still maintaining the secure exterior. 
Customization:Upload to Abobe illustrator. If you’d like to futher customize the enclosure you can download the previously created design and upload it to adobe illustrator. 
Using the selection tool you can drag edges as preferred for any customized sides or pieces.
Print a prototype. Once you’ve completed any customization and finalized the design you can now print a protoype on cardboard to ensure the size works for your project before printing on acrylic.
Adjust if needed and print final enclosure. Make as many adjustments as needed repeating steps 3-5 and using cardboard prototypes. Once you have a design that fits your project, print on acrylic and put your final enclosure together.
