## How to create an acrylic enclosure:

Short summary of why an enclosure is necessary, i.e the benefits

Things you should know/Things to keep in mind:

- List of items you will need
- List of things you’ll need to prepare in advance
- List of experiences that might be required, relevant or helpful to complete the task

Steps (including pictures):

Build your project
- Prototyping on a solderless breadboard 
- Running tests

Solder your project
- Take measurement of how large you’d like the enclosure to be and in what position you like your circuit placed 
- Solder the project 
    - How to solder
        - Pins, wires, resistors, etc. 
    - How the soldering board will be positioned with the Arduino
- Soldering Tips:
    - When to use stranded vs solid wire
    - How long to cut the wire
    - How to keep measurement and positioning in mind
    - How to fix a soldering mistake 
Test the soldered project
- Make sure it works before moving onto the enclosure
- Debugging 
Design the enclosure
- Go to https://en.makercase.com/ 
- Decide which box design 
    - List benefits to the different types of designs
- Input measurements for the box
- Check the visualization and Save 
Print with a laser cutting machine
- Upload the file to adobe illustrator 
- Follow laser cutting instructions
- Print a prototype on cardboard
- Test the enclosure with your soldered project
- If adjustments are necessary revisit step 4, if not proceed to print on acrylic
Put the enclosure together
- Once the pieces are printed, put the box together 
- Test again for any errors
