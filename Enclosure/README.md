## How to create an acrylic enclosure:

Short summary of why an enclosure is necessary, i.e the benefits

Things you should know/Things to keep in mind:

- List of items you will need
- List of things you’ll need to prepare in advance
- List of experiences that might be required, relevant or helpful to complete the task

Steps (including pictures):

Build your project
- Prototyping on a solderless breadboard 
- Running tests
- 

Solder your project
- Take measurement of how large you’d like the enclosure to be and in what position you like your circuit placed 
- Solder the project 
    - How to solder
        - Pins, wires, resistors, etc. 
    - How the soldering board will be positioned with the Arduino
- Soldering Tips:
    - When to use stranded vs solid wire
    - How long to cut the wire
    - How to keep measurement and positioning in mind
    - How to fix a soldering mistake 
    
    
Test the soldered project
- Make sure it works before moving onto the enclosure
- Debugging 

Desinging the Enclosure: 

1. Figure what kind of enclosure you want. Enclosures can be made out of many different materials depending on the purpose and usage of the project. However, for this section we will focus on acrylic for the enclosure. 
    - Benefits for acrylic:
        - Excellent optical clarity & transparency
        - Highly resistant to variations in temperature
        - Up to 17 times the impact resistance of ordinary glass
        - Half the weight of glass and idea for precision machining
        - Highly resistant to different chemicals
    - Disadvantages for acrylic:
        - Acrylic is touch and durable, but can also be easily scratched
2. Choose an enclosure design. Using a design platform like, https://en.makercase.com/, you can choose from 3 different enclosure designs: Basic box, polygon box, kerf bent box. 
3. Modify enclosure design. Using the same platform you can now modify the box your creating. 
    - Modifications include width, height, and depth of the box. Using the prior measurements you took input the amounts to see a virtual display of your enclosure.You     can also indicate whether the measurements are for the inner or outer dimensions.
    - The thickness of your box should correspond to the acrylic piece you will be using.
    - You can also decide whether you’d like the box to be open or closed
    - Finally, choose the type of edge you’d like for the box. Using a flat or finger edge will require the use of acrylic glue to stablize the enclosure. Note: if you     need to access the inside of the box, this would be made difficult with these choices. Alternatively, t-slot edges are held with bolts. You can decide the type of      bolt diameter and length depending on what you have available. This allows you to access the inside of the box if any debugging or adjustments are necessary while      still maintaining the secure exterior. 
4. Customization:Upload to Abobe illustrator. If you’d like to futher customize the enclosure you can download the previously created design and upload it to adobe illustrator. 
    - Using the selection tool you can drag edges as preferred for any customized sides or pieces.
5. Print a prototype. Once you’ve completed any customization and finalized the design you can now print a protoype on cardboard to ensure the size works for your project before printing on acrylic.
6. Adjust if needed and print final enclosure. Make as many adjustments as needed repeating steps 3-5 and using cardboard prototypes. Once you have a design that fits your project, print on acrylic and put your final enclosure together. 



Print with a laser cutting machine
- Upload the file to adobe illustrator 
- Follow laser cutting instructions
- Print a prototype on cardboard
- Test the enclosure with your soldered project
- If adjustments are necessary revisit step 4, if not proceed to print on acrylic


Put the enclosure together
- Once the pieces are printed, put the box together 
- Test again for any errors
